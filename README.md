# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard


For this project, we assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Our job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. We visualized the data in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
